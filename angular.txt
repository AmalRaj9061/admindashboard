                   Angular -it is a front end development tool 


        Basic comments in Angular 
          --------------------


    1. To create an Angular Porject --  ng new project-name
    2. To run an Angular project    --  ng serve / ng s
    3. To geneRate a component      --  ng g c component-name
    4. To generate service : ng g s --  service-folder/service-name



    
          Basic concepts in Angular
            --------------------

    1. Modules --> To import third party libraries ,also used to hold component
    2. component --> Basic building blocks of angular html,css, Ts ,and also have selector
    3.  selector --> to replace selector tag with its html page
    4. Decerator --> To hold meta data, start with @
    5. to view a componentin another page ----

                *  set up a path for component --  app-routing -module
                *  router-outlet--  to navigate according to the user requested page


    6. data binding  -->  a data with in a component
         two types of data sharing :

              1*  One way binding
                    data communication between TS(type script) to html or/ html to TS .
                    data sharing in one direction.
                    ithil TS ne common ayit parayuka "compnent" ennum html ne "view" ennum aan parayuka

                    (TS to html)
                          6.1.1   string interpolation
                              syntax :  {{class property-name}}
                          6.1.2   property binding    
                              syntax : [attribute-name]="property"


                One way binding to html(view) - Ts (component)

                       6.2.1    event binding
                             
                             syntax : (event-name)="function call"   
                       6.2.2 event binding (using $(doller) event)

                             syntax : (event-name)="function-name($event)"   
                       6.2.3 using template reference variable  (#)

                             syntax : # variable-name            


              2*  Two way binding -- data sharing in both direction
                     
                      ngModel import formModule in appModule 
                         
                           syntax :  [(ngModel)]="class property"

>  Generally binding is used for data collection
       7. Angular Forms
            1. template driven forms -- html page then it is known as template driven forms 
            2. model driven form     -- it has a view we can write TS then we create html page .ie.  known as model driven       

            navigateByUrl-router class
       8. Dependancy injection : to share data between dependent classes

                  syntax : constructor (access-specifier variable-name:class-name){


                  }    

            * variable-dependent class variable

       9. angular service           

           eg:    login page  -->  sevice  -->home page

      10. Angular directives : DOM manipulation

            10.1 component view \component Directive   
            10.2 structural Directive \ structural view
                   syntax : *ngFor="let variable-name of array-name"
            10.3 attribute Directive : at app        


      11. parent-child data sharing

                - child to parent communication     @output Decerator
                - parent to child communication     @input  Decorator
